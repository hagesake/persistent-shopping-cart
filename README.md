# Persistent Shopping Cart

This is basic example of a shopping cart built with [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

The data stored in the cart is persistent through page refreshing and browser session ended. This functionality is achieved thanks to the **_redux-persist_** package (See the [Github](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist#readme) repository)

## Project setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the necessary dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```bash
  npm run dev
```
